# FONA-3G-GPS
Arduino code for a FONA 3G GPS
This code is for a senior design project, the KRUPS_GPS_1 is the final version that was used on the capsule.
This code connects to the module then after typing "R" to run the code it turns on the gps, queries the location
then texts the location to a programmed cell phone number.
